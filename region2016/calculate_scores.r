## calculate_scores.R

## calculate_scores.R ensures all files are properly configured and calculates OHI scores.
  ## - configure_toolbox.r ensures your files are properly configured. It is a script in your repository.
  ## - CalculateAll() calculates OHI scores. It is a function in the `ohicore` R package
  ##   (this can be written in R as `ohicore::CalculateAll()`).

## When you begin, configure_toolbox.r and CalculateAll() will calculate scores using
## the 'templated' data and goal models provided. We suggest you work
## goal-by-goal as you prepare data in the prep folder and develop goal models
## in functions.r. Running configure_toolbox.r and a specific goal model line-by-line
## in functions.R is a good workflow.

## choose directory
wd <- 'region2016/'

## run the configure_toolbox.r script to check configuration
source(paste0(wd,'configure_toolbox.r'))

## calculate scenario scores
scores = ohicore::CalculateAll(conf, layers)

## save scores as scores.csv
write.csv(scores, paste0(wd,'scores.csv'), na='', row.names=F)
